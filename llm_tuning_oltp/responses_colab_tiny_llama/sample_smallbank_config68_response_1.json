Here's the recommended configuration buckets for the database according to the provided internal metrics:

- "max_wal_senders": "30-40%", this configuration suggests increasing the maximum number of wal senders to improve send and receive performance. - "autovacuum_max_workers": "50-60%", this recommendation increases the maximum number of vacuum operators to improve vacuum efficiency. - "max_connections": "70-80%", increasing the maximum number of connections can help prevent degradation of performance caused by overcrowded databases. - "wal_buffers": "50-60%", increasing the wal buffers allocation can improve page flushes and reduce the overhead of writing to disk. - "shared_buffers": "40-50%", this recommendation increases the shared buffers allocation to improve I/O performance and prevent fragmentation. - "autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor": "20-30%", this setting adjusts the analyze scale factor to improve the accuracy of vacuum maintenance tasks. - "autovacuum_analyze_threshold": "40-50%", increasing the analyze threshold can improve the performance of vacuum maintenance tasks. - "autovacuum_naptime": "90-100%", this value adjusts the naptime for vacuum cascades, which reduces the idle processing time between vacuum operations. - "autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay": "80-90%", increasing the vacuum cost delay adjusts the cost of vacuum operations, which affects the performance of vacuum maintenance tasks. - "autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit": "80-90%", increasing the vacuum cost limit increases the cost of vacuum operations to improve the effectiveness of vacuum maintenance tasks.
